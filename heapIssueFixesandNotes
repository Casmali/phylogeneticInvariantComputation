gislinux1@GISLinux1:~$ export GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE=2G
gislinux1@GISLinux1:~$ M2


S_4 no problem 

S_5 ran(go back and double check that it needed the heap fix 



S_6 still working on getting this running


S_6 Error: 
o29 : RingMap S <--- R
Too many heap sections: Increase MAXHINCR or MAX_HEAP_SECTS
Aborted (core dumped)

Ok so..... ONce we got to S_6 we kept having it, 8GB did not work, I am trying 12 GB now.... If this doesnt work I might bump up to 16 but at that point I would really need to start considering how to use ram from other machines so I can have a ridiculous amount of ram......... lol.... 


ok well we ran into an error again..... I am going to try to increase one final time to 16 GB of ram.... 
Did not work!
  Holy fuck lol.....
